#  over view of the project
  The C Binary Trees project is a collaborative endeavor focused on developing efficient algorithms and data structures for handling binary trees. Through close teamwork, the group aims to implement key operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching within binary trees, while optimizing for both time and space complexities. By diving into the intricacies of tree structures and drawing inspiration from resources like "Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree," "Binary tree" (distinct from B-trees), and "Binary Search Tree," the project not only enhances the participants' understanding of fundamental data structures but also sharpens their problem-solving skills and proficiency in the C programming language. Engaging with materials on "Tree Traversal" further enriches their grasp of tree manipulation techniques, culminating in a comprehensive exploration of binary trees as a pivotal data structure.

# Requirements
# General
# Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 # All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
# All your files should end with a new line
# A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
# Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
# You are not allowed to use global variables
# No more than 5 functions per file
# You are allowed to use the standard library
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
# Don’t forget to push your header file
# All your header files should be include guarded
